  <p> Ok let's get on with it </p>
  <div class="one">
    <h2> Procrastinating: <small>A simple how to</small> </h2>
  <h4 class="intro"> Step-1 </h4>
  
  <p> The first step to procrastinating is actually <strong> STARTING </strong> your work. Now you may be thinking, "But isn't the whole point to <em>NOT</em> do my work?"... To that I say, "Yes that's exactly right!" By starting your work, you open up opportunities to look for excuses to stop working.</p>

  <h4 class="intro"> Step-2 </h4>
  <p> Now that you've started to work, look at all your options to distract yourself! If you wanted to, you could watch that new show you started, or look for a new show! Another idea is to wreck some 12 year olds on Fortnite. Don't worry, if you can't find something to do, you're already procrastinating by looking for something else. </p>

   <h4 class="intro"> Step-3 </h4>
    <p> <strong> PAIN.</strong> ...You should have done your work, and now you gotta stay up all night trying to crank it out like you use to crank that soulja boy in '07 </p>

    <h2 class="end"> That's how you procrastinate </h2> 
    <p> <small> indulge at your own risk, it is not always succesful so just try and do your work </small> </p>
